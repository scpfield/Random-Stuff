    This is an implementation of a HackerRank test that I 
    did, which wanted a function to generate version numbers
    between a start + end value.  The input data should be 
    a list of strings describing the start + end ranges of
    two version numbers, each having with 3 components, 
    in the following format:

    "a.b.c to x.y.z"

    There could potentially be an infinite number of 
    versions in between the start and end ranges.

    The following program will print all the version
    numbers in between the start + end versions with one 
    restriction:

    For each component of a version:

     major.minor.incremental

    Each is assumed to be 8 bits / 1 byte, which gives 
    the maximum integer ranges per component:

    (0 -> 255).(0 -> 255).(0 -> 255)
      major      minor       inc


    This program consists of 2 functions, one to parse
    the input data, and one to calculate + print the
    versions.

    There is a "main" at the bottom which can be used
    to customize the input data.

def PrintFunction( VersionNumbers ):


    '''

    This is the main print function, which calculates
    and prints all the versions in between the start +
    end ranges from the input data.

    From the 3 component numbers, assuming to be max
    of 1-byte each, it creates 3-byte numbers by
    shifting the bits.

    Then it simply increments the starting number
    until it reaches the end number, extracting the
    updated component values as it goes.

    Example.  Given a range:

        1.0.0 to 1.2.5

    There will be version numbers generated for:

        1.0.(0 -> 255)
        1.1.(0 -> 255)
        1.2.(0 -> 5)
