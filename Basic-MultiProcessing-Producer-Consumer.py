#  This is a basic message producer -> consumer using
#  the Python multiprocessing package and a shared queue, 
#  which is Python's solution for achieving parallel 
#  execution across multiple CPUs.  
#  
#  You can also write threads in Python but they can't
#  run in parallel due to the Global Interpeter Lock.
#  Python threads can run concurrently, but not in Parallel.
#
#  It is neat, with the multiprocessing package,
#  it's pretty much identical to how you code a 
#  multi-threaded program, and it runs in parallel 
#  across multiple CPUs, without very much extra work.
